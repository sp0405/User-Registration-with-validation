The User Registration and Validation Project is developed to create a secure and interactive platform where new users can register by entering their personal details such as name, email, and password. The project ensures that every input is properly validated before submission â€” for example, checking that the email is in the correct format, all required fields are filled, and the passwords match. This helps in preventing incorrect or incomplete data from being stored. The system provides instant feedback to users if any input is invalid, improving the overall user experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on Netlify, this project demonstrates the essential concepts of web form design, client-side validation, and data accuracy in modern web applications.
